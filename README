# Quick info

The ./run script (without arguments) can be used to select benchmarks and generate a table.

# Files description

benchmarks : source files for benchmarks
cbmc       : should be linked to the desired cbmc version
convert    : AWK script to convert ./run's output to a LaTex table. Used by texify
data.tex   : The data part of the latex table, generated by convert
dporc      : should be linked to the desired dporc version
goto-instr : Script to connect the components needed to evaluate with goto-instrument
metadata   : comments from ./run's output. Used by texify
originals  : original version of benchmarks
results    : directory containing benchmark run results. ./run writes there
run        : Main script. Also calls texify.
table.pdf  : default name of the report generated by texify.
table.tex  : template to include data.tex.
texify     : single argument script, converts any of run's reports to data.tex and metadata

# Regarding goto-instrument

To run a benchmark under goto-instrument we used four components:
- goto-cc : A compiler from C to GOTO programs
- goto-instrument: A tool that converts a GOTO program to another GOTO program, including memory architecture constructs
- satabs: A tool that abstracts the GOTO program into a Boolean program which can be fed to a model checker
- boom: A model checker

The ./goto-instr script connects all these components correctly.

Due to incompatibilities between the available versions of the tools we used the following combination:

'Binary' refers to : http://www.cprover.org/satabs/download/satabs-3-2-linux-32.tgz
'Source' refers to : svn co http://www.cprover.org/svn/cbmc/releases/cbmc-4.5

- goto-cc : From the Binary
- goto-instrument : Compiled from Source, to have the --minimum-interference option and fixes for some assertion failures.
- satabs : From the Binary
- boom :  From the Binary
